    Solve process:
    1. Identify and convert morse to text for each track. Each one is a meme.
    2. Order tracks by octave (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B). Exactly 12 tracks = 12 notes in an octave.
    3. Find extra letter in each track title by comparing to one of the words in morse -> "BPM MOD TWO SIX".
    4. Get the BPM for each track (using an app / website), then mod by 26 to get the letter -> "PIXAR FAST KID".
    5. Answer is "DASH"... thematic to morse code!
